# key_details, a value to introduce more KeyDetails for current car model
key_details="The Buick Grand National (1982-1987) was a high-performance version of the Buick Regal, featuring a turbocharged 3.8L V6 engine. The GNX (Grand National Experimental) variant produced 276 hp and 360 lb-ft of torque, making it one of the fastest American cars of its era. Known as the 'Darth Vader' of muscle cars due to its all-black appearance, it could out-accelerate contemporary Corvettes and Porsches. Production was limited, with only 547 GNX models made in 1987."
key_details_comments = "The Buick Grand National (1982-1987) represents a unique chapter in American muscle car history, being one of the few performance vehicles from GM's Buick division. Its turbocharged 3.8L V6 was revolutionary for its time, offering Corvette-beating acceleration from an unlikely source. The GNX variant, developed with McLaren Performance Technologies, featured upgraded turbocharger, intercooler, and suspension components that pushed output to 276 hp and 360 lb-ft of torque - remarkable figures for a production V6 in the 1980s. The car's menacing all-black appearance earned it nicknames like 'Darth Vader' and 'Black Arrow,' while its limited production (particularly the 547-unit GNX run) has made it a highly collectible modern classic. Performance figures included 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds and quarter-mile times in the low 13s, making it one of the quickest American production cars of its era."
