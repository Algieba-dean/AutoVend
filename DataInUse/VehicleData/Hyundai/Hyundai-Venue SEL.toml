[KeyDetails]
# key_details, a value to introduce more KeyDetails for current car model
key_details="The Hyundai Venue SEL combines subcompact SUV practicality with value-focused features, including an 8-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and Hyundai SmartSense safety suite. Its 1.6L engine prioritizes reliability over performance, making it ideal for urban environments. The tall seating position and boxy design maximize interior space despite the small footprint."
key_details_comments = "The Hyundai Venue SEL represents Hyundai's entry into the subcompact SUV segment, offering a compelling blend of urban-friendly dimensions (just 4 meters long) and SUV practicality. Its 1.6L naturally aspirated engine delivers adequate 121 hp for city driving while maintaining good fuel efficiency (7.1L/100km combined). The SEL trim adds key features like an 8-inch touchscreen with smartphone integration, automatic emergency braking, and lane keep assist - unusual for this price segment. The tall roofline (1,590mm) and boxy shape maximize interior space, offering 2.8 cubic meters of passenger volume despite the compact footprint. While not luxurious, it provides excellent value with Hyundai's 5-year/60,000-mile warranty. The discontinuation of AWD after 2022 positions it firmly as an urban commuter rather than adventure vehicle."
