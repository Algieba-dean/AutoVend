key_details_comments = "The Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Ultimate Track-Ready Version is the most extreme road-legal iteration of Porsche's mid-engine platform, featuring a motorsport-derived 4.0L naturally aspirated flat-six engine (shared with the 911 GT3) producing 493 hp at 8,400 rpm. It incorporates extensive weight reduction measures including carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) front fenders, hood, and rear wing, bringing DIN weight to just 1,415 kg. The Ultimate Track-Ready specification adds the Weissach Package with magnesium wheels (saving 10 kg unsprung mass), additional CFRP components, and track telemetry system. Aerodynamics generate GT3 Cup car-level downforce, while the suspension features Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) with track-specific tuning and 30mm lower ride height. The interior features full carbon fiber bucket seats, Race-Tex surfaces, and a lightweight sound package that reduces NVH materials by 50% compared to standard models."
