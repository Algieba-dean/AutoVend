# key_details, a value to introduce more KeyDetails for current car model
key_details="The Porsche 718 Boxster represents the entry point to Porsche's mid-engine roadster lineage, featuring a turbocharged flat-four engine mounted behind the seats for optimal weight distribution. Its fabric roof retracts in 9 seconds at speeds up to 50 km/h (31 mph), transforming it into an open-air sports car. The base model comes with 18-inch wheels, Porsche Active Suspension Management (optional), and a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission (manual available). Characteristic Porsche traits include a low center of gravity (just 1,280mm tall), near-perfect 47:53 weight distribution, and the distinctive boxer engine sound. While less powerful than the S or GTS variants, the base model delivers authentic Porsche driving dynamics at a more accessible price point."
key_details_comments = "The Porsche 718 Boxster Base Convertible Roadster embodies Porsche's pure roadster philosophy with a mid-engine layout and perfect 47:53 weight distribution. Its turbocharged 2.0L flat-four boxer engine delivers 300hp through either a 6-speed manual or 7-speed PDK transmission, with the convertible soft top operating in just 9 seconds at speeds up to 50 km/h. The chassis features Porsche's signature precision with MacPherson strut front and multi-link rear suspension, while the compact 4,379mm length makes it agile on twisty roads. Though positioned as the entry model, it retains all the essential Porsche DNA including the low-slung cockpit position, driver-focused ergonomics, and characteristic boxer engine sound. The two-trunk design (150L front + 125L rear) offers surprising practicality for weekend trips, while the standard Porsche Communication Management (PCM) infotainment provides modern connectivity. This base model serves as an accessible gateway to Porsche ownership while still delivering the brand's renowned driving dynamics."
