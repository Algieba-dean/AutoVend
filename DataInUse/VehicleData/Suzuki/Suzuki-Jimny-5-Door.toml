[KeyDetails]
# key_details, a value to introduce more KeyDetails for current car model
key_details="The Suzuki Jimny 5-Door maintains the iconic off-road capability of the 3-door version while adding practicality with extended wheelbase and rear doors. It features a body-on-frame construction, part-time 4WD with low-range gearing, and excellent approach/departure angles. While basic in terms of comfort and technology, it excels as a capable and affordable off-roader."
key_details_comments = "The Suzuki Jimny 5-Door expands on the legendary off-road prowess of its 3-door sibling while addressing practicality concerns. Its 340mm longer wheelbase (2,590mm total) improves rear passenger space and adds conventional rear doors for easier access. The body-on-frame construction, rigid axle suspension, and part-time 4WD system with low-range transfer case maintain exceptional off-road capability (37° approach angle, 210mm ground clearance). While interior tech remains basic, it offers surprising versatility with 60:40 split folding rear seats that expand cargo capacity from 208L to 863L. The 1.5L K15B gasoline engine delivers adequate 102hp for both urban and trail use, though highway refinement is compromised by the boxy aerodynamics. This model successfully balances the Jimny's iconic off-road character with improved everyday usability."
