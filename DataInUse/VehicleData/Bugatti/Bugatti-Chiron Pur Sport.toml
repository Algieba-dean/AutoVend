key_details="The Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport is a track-focused variant of the Chiron, featuring a 1,500 PS W16 engine, reduced weight, optimized aerodynamics, and a shorter gear ratio for improved acceleration. It represents the pinnacle of Bugatti's road-legal hypercar technology with a top speed limited to 350 km/h."
key_details_comments = "The Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport represents the ultimate expression of Bugatti's hypercar philosophy, optimized for maximum agility and track performance. It features a 1,500 PS (1,103 kW) quad-turbocharged 8.0L W16 engine with revised gear ratios for quicker acceleration, extensive use of lightweight materials (saving 50kg vs standard Chiron), and aggressive aerodynamics including a fixed rear wing generating increased downforce. The Pur Sport variant trades ultimate top speed for enhanced cornering capability, with a 350 km/h (217 mph) electronically limited top speed and specially developed Michelin Cup 2 R tires. Every component is engineered for extreme performance, from its titanium exhaust system to its motorsport-inspired suspension tuning, making it one of the most capable road-legal track cars ever produced."
