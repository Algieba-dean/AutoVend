key_details="The Porsche-718 Boxster EV S Enhanced Electric Convertible represents Porsche's first all-electric Boxster, combining classic roadster proportions with cutting-edge EV technology. It features a 105 kWh battery pack, dual-motor all-wheel drive producing 603 hp, and a WLTP range of 550 km. The car maintains the mid-engine balance of combustion Boxsters through intelligent battery placement and weighs just 1,650 kg thanks to extensive use of aluminum and composite materials. Signature Porsche features include a fully electric version of the iconic PDK transmission with simulated gear shifts, adaptive suspension, and rear-wheel steering. The convertible top operates at speeds up to 50 km/h and folds in 10 seconds."
key_details_comments = "The Porsche-718 Boxster EV S Enhanced Electric Convertible represents a groundbreaking evolution of Porsche's iconic roadster, transitioning to full electrification while maintaining the brand's performance DNA. Its 105 kWh battery pack is strategically placed in a mid-engine position to preserve the Boxster's perfect weight distribution. The dual-motor AWD system delivers instant 603 hp power and 750 N·m torque, enabling 0-100 km/h in just 3.2 seconds. Porsche's engineering excellence shines through in details like the simulated PDK gear shifts that maintain driver engagement, the adaptive suspension with rear-wheel steering for precision handling, and the ultra-fast folding convertible top that operates while moving. Despite its performance focus, it achieves a practical 550 km WLTP range thanks to advanced thermal management and regenerative braking systems. The extensive use of lightweight materials keeps curb weight to just 1,650 kg - remarkable for an EV of this capability."
