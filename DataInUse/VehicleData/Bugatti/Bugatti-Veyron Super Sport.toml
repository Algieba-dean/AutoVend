key_details = "The Bugatti Veyron Super Sport (2010-2011) is one of the most iconic hypercars ever made, featuring an 8.0L quad-turbo W16 engine producing 1,200 PS. It held the production car speed record at 431 km/h (268 mph) during testing, though production models were limited to 415 km/h. Only 30 Super Sport models were produced, plus 5 even rarer World Record Editions. The car features a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, carbon ceramic brakes, and an advanced all-wheel-drive system to manage its incredible power. The body is constructed from carbon fiber with extensive use of lightweight materials, yet still weighs 1,838 kg due to its massive engine and luxury appointments."
key_details_comments = "The Bugatti Veyron Super Sport represents the pinnacle of early 2010s hypercar engineering, featuring an unprecedented 8.0L quad-turbo W16 engine that produces 1,200 PS (1,184 hp) and 1,500 N·m of torque. This limited-production model (only 30 units made) was the fastest production car in the world from 2010-2017, with a tested top speed of 431 km/h (268 mph) - though production versions were electronically limited to 415 km/h for safety. The car's technological marvels include a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, carbon ceramic braking system capable of handling 1,500°C temperatures, and an advanced all-wheel-drive system to manage the immense power. Despite extensive use of carbon fiber and other lightweight materials, the Veyron Super Sport weighs 1,838 kg due to its massive engine and luxury interior appointments. The vehicle represents a perfect balance between extreme performance (0-100 km/h in 2.5 seconds) and Bugatti's legendary craftsmanship, with each car requiring hundreds of hours of hand assembly in Molsheim, France."
