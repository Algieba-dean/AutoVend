key_details="The Buick Avista was a concept car unveiled in 2016 that showcased Buick's new design language and performance potential. Though never produced, it featured a twin-turbocharged 3.0L V6 engine, rear-wheel drive platform, and a sleek 2+2 coupe body style. The concept won multiple design awards and influenced Buick's production models."
key_details_comments = "The Buick Avista was a groundbreaking concept car unveiled at the 2016 North American International Auto Show, representing Buick's bold new design direction and performance aspirations. This rear-wheel drive 2+2 coupe featured a potent twin-turbocharged 3.0L V6 engine producing approximately 400 horsepower, marking a significant departure from Buick's traditional image. The concept's flowing, sculpted bodywork with minimal shut lines earned it multiple design awards and influenced subsequent Buick production models. While never reaching production, the Avista demonstrated Buick's potential to compete in the premium sports coupe segment, featuring advanced technologies like torque vectoring, a premium interior with technical fabrics and aluminum trim, and semi-autonomous driving capabilities. The concept's overwhelmingly positive reception reportedly led GM to consider putting it into production, though it ultimately remained a design study."
