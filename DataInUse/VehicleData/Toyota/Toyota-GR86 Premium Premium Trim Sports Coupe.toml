key_details="The Toyota GR86 Premium is a lightweight, rear-wheel-drive sports coupe developed in collaboration with Subaru. It features a 2.4L boxer engine, perfect 53:47 weight distribution, and track-focused chassis tuning while maintaining daily drivability. The Premium trim adds Alcantara/leather seats, dual-zone climate control, and upgraded audio system."
key_details_comments = "The Toyota GR86 Premium represents the pinnacle of affordable sports car engineering, featuring a collaborative design with Subaru that combines Toyota's reliability with Subaru's boxer engine expertise. Its 2.4L naturally aspirated FA24 engine delivers 228 horsepower through a choice of 6-speed manual or automatic transmissions. The Premium trim enhances the driving experience with features like heated Alcantara/leather seats, an 8-speaker premium audio system, and keyless entry while maintaining the model's core focus on driving purity. The chassis boasts near-perfect weight distribution (53:47) and a low center of gravity from the boxer engine layout, making it exceptionally balanced for both daily driving and track use. The GR86's design includes functional aerodynamic elements like underbody panels and a rear ducktail spoiler that generate downforce at speed. Despite its performance focus, it maintains practical elements like a usable trunk (195L capacity) and 2+2 seating, though rear seats are best suited for small packages or children."
