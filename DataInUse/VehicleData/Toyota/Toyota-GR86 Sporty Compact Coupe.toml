key_details_comments = "The Toyota GR86 represents the purest form of affordable sports car engineering, co-developed with Subaru to share its boxer engine architecture. The 2.4L FA24 engine delivers 228 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, with a 7,500 rpm redline for thrilling high-RPM performance. Its lightweight chassis (approximately 1,270 kg/2,800 lbs) features a near-perfect 53:47 weight distribution, achieved through the low-mounted boxer engine and rear-wheel-drive layout. The GR86 boasts a 50% stiffer front suspension mounting and 60% stiffer rear chassis structure compared to its predecessor, with aerodynamic enhancements including functional front air ducts and a rear ducktail spoiler. The interior features driver-focused elements like a 7-inch digital instrument cluster, thick-rimmed steering wheel, and available Alcantara-trimmed seats with GR embroidery. Performance Package models add Sachs dampers, Brembo brakes, and Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires. The 6-speed manual transmission features rev-matching downshifts, while the available 6-speed automatic includes paddle shifters and a Sport mode. Track enthusiasts will appreciate the standard Torsen limited-slip differential and available Track driving mode that reduces stability intervention."
