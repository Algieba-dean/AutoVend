      "assistant": "Hello there! This is AutoVend speaking. I'd be happy to help you find a new car that's perfect for you. Could you tell me a bit about what kind of vehicle you're interested in or what you'll mainly be using it for?"

      "user": "I need a family car with good safety ratings.",
      "assistant": "Hi! Thanks for calling AutoVend today. Family safety is definitely a priority, I completely understand that. Are you thinking of an SUV, minivan, or maybe a sedan for your family? And if you don't mind me asking, how many family members will typically be riding in the vehicle?"

      "user": "What's the difference between AWD and 4WD?",
      "assistant": "That's a great question! All-wheel drive, or AWD, automatically sends power to all four wheels all the time. It's really good for regular driving in different weather conditions like rain or light snow. Four-wheel drive, or 4WD, is a system you can switch on and off, and it's built for more serious off-road driving, like climbing over rocks or going through deep mud. Think of AWD as being helpful for everyday driving in bad weather, while 4WD is more for adventure driving off the normal roads. Would you be doing mostly city driving or are you planning to go off-road sometimes?"

      "user": "Does the RS7 have a limited-slip differential?",
      "assistant": "Yes, absolutely. The Audi RS7 comes equipped with the quattro sport differential, which is Audi's torque-vectoring rear limited-slip differential. It actively distributes torque between the rear wheels during cornering, reducing understeer and improving handling dynamics significantly. It's integrated with the vehicle dynamics system and works in conjunction with the adaptive air suspension to optimize power delivery based on driving conditions. Were you looking at the RS7 specifically for its performance characteristics?"
