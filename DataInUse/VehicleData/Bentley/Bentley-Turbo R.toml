The 'R' stood for 'Roadholding', highlighting its improved handling characteristics. The Turbo R featured a specially tuned suspension, wider tires, and subtle aerodynamic enhancements. It became known as the 'thinking person's supercar' for its combination of effortless performance and understated elegance. Production spanned 14 years with continuous improvements, making it one of Bentley's most successful models of the era."
key_details_comments = "The Bentley Turbo R (1985-1999) revolutionized Bentley's image by combining traditional British luxury with serious performance credentials. As the first Bentley to truly emphasize handling (the 'R' stands for Roadholding), it featured a specially developed suspension system, wider tires, and subtle aerodynamic tweaks. Powered by a turbocharged 6.75-liter V8 producing up to 420hp, it could accelerate from 0-100 km/h in 6.2 seconds while maintaining Bentley's legendary refinement. The interior showcased handcrafted wood veneers, Connolly leather, and Wilton carpeting. Over its 14-year production run, the Turbo R evolved through several series, with later models featuring electronic fuel injection and improved turbocharging. It became Bentley's best-selling model at the time, successfully bridging the gap between stately luxury and genuine high performance."
