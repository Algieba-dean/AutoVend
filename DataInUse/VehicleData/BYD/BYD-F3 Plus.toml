key_details="The BYD-F3 Plus is an affordable compact sedan with a focus on practicality and reliability. It features a 1.5L gasoline engine, front-wheel drive, and a simple yet functional interior. While it lacks advanced technology and safety features, it offers good value for budget-conscious buyers in emerging markets."
key_details_comments = "The BYD-F3 Plus is positioned as an entry-level compact sedan targeting budget-conscious buyers in developing markets. Its 1.5L naturally aspirated gasoline engine delivers adequate performance for daily commuting while maintaining reasonable fuel efficiency. The vehicle prioritizes practicality with its 360L trunk capacity and 5-seat configuration, though it lacks modern safety and connectivity features found in more expensive models. The simple mechanical layout with front-wheel drive and independent suspension makes it economical to maintain. While the design is conservative and interior materials are basic, it offers reliable transportation at an accessible price point between $12,000-$18,000 USD. This model is particularly popular in markets where low purchase price and operating costs are prioritized over advanced features."
