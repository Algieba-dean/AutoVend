# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Technical Guide

## Introduction

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an innovative AI technology that significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of AI systems by combining external knowledge retrieval with large language model generation capabilities.

## Core Concepts

### What is RAG?

RAG is a two-stage process:

## Application Scenarios

### 1. Enterprise Knowledge Base
```python
# Example: Enterprise Document Retrieval System
class EnterpriseRAG:
    def __init__(self):
        self.retriever = DocumentRetriever()
        self.llm = LanguageModel()
    
    def answer_query(self, query):
        relevant_docs = self.retriever.search(query)
        context = self.prepare_context(relevant_docs)
        return self.llm.generate(query, context)
```
