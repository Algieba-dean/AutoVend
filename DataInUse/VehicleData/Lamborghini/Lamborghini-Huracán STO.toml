key_details="The Huracán STO (Super Trofeo Omologata) is a road-legal version of Lamborghini's GT3 race car, featuring extensive use of carbon fiber (75kg weight savings over Huracán EVO), Brembo CCM-R ceramic brakes, and aerodynamics generating 53% more downforce than the Performante. The 5.2L V10 produces 640hp at 8,000rpm with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Special features include Bridgestone Potenza Race tires, torque vectoring, and three driving modes (STO, Trofeo, Pioggia) optimized for different track conditions."
key_details_comments = "The Huracán STO (Super Trofeo Omologata) represents Lamborghini's ultimate track-focused road car, homologated from their Super Trofeo race series. It features 75kg of weight reduction through extensive carbon fiber use (including the entire front clamshell), race-derived aerodynamics producing 420kg of downforce at 275km/h, and a rear-wheel steering system. The 5.2L naturally aspirated V10 delivers 640hp through a lightning-fast 7-speed dual-clutch transmission with launch control. Unique features include the cofango (combined front hood/fender), Brembo CCM-R carbon-ceramic brakes with 6-piston calipers, and specialized Bridgestone Potenza Race tires developed specifically for this model. The interior features full carbon fiber racing seats with 4-point harness mounts, a digital motorsport-inspired display, and a stripped-out, driver-focused cockpit that eliminates unnecessary comforts for weight savings."
