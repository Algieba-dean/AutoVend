[KeyDetails]
# key_details, a value to introduce more KeyDetails for current car model
key_details = "The Suzuki-Celerio-X is a compact, fuel-efficient city car with a sporty design. It features a 1.0L 3-cylinder engine, front-wheel drive, and a practical interior. Ideal for urban commuting, it offers good fuel economy and maneuverability but lacks advanced tech and comfort features for long-distance travel."
key_details_comments = "The Suzuki-Celerio-X is a purpose-built urban commuter designed for efficiency and practicality. Its compact 1.0L 3-cylinder gasoline engine delivers excellent fuel economy (4.7L/100km) while producing 67hp, making it ideal for city driving. The micro sedan classification reflects its 2425mm wheelbase and 3.0 cubic meter passenger volume, offering just enough space for four adults. While it lacks advanced driver assistance systems and premium features, it includes essential safety equipment like ABS and ESP. The sporty design with bright color options and metal trim interior gives it youthful appeal. With a 32L fuel tank providing about 350km range, front-wheel drive, and independent suspension, it handles urban environments well but isn't suited for long highway trips or rough terrain. The 254L trunk (expandable to 726L) offers surprising utility for its class."
