class LoRALayer:
    def __init__(self, base_layer, rank=4):
        self.base = base_layer
        self.lora_A = LowRankMatrix(rank)
        self.lora_B = LowRankMatrix(rank)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        base_output = self.base(x)
        lora_output = self.lora_B(self.lora_A(x))
        return base_output + lora_output
