key_details="The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 is a mid-engine hypercar produced from 2005-2015. It features an 8.0L quad-turbo W16 engine producing between 987-1184hp, making it one of the fastest production cars of its time with a top speed over 400km/h. The Veyron was the first production car to break the 1000hp barrier and set new standards for hypercar performance. Its development cost Volkswagen over $1.6 billion USD. Only 450 units were produced across all variants."
key_details_comments = "The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 redefined hypercar benchmarks when launched in 2005, featuring groundbreaking engineering including a quad-turbocharged 8.0L W16 engine producing between 987-1184hp depending on variant. It was the first production car to exceed 1000hp and 400km/h (officially limited to 407 km/h). The development represented a massive technical challenge - requiring 10 radiators to cool the powertrain and special Michelin tires rated for 431 km/h. Only 450 units were hand-built at Bugatti's Molsheim factory over its 10-year production run, with each car requiring approximately 3 months to assemble. The Veyron's $1.7 million price tag reflected its extreme performance and the estimated $1.6 billion development cost underwritten by Volkswagen Group."
