The interior features sustainable materials like recycled fishing nets in the carpet fibers."
key_details_comments = "The Audi e-tron GT is built on the premium J1 platform co-developed with Porsche, sharing technology with the Taycan while maintaining distinct Audi characteristics. Its 800V electrical architecture enables industry-leading 270 kW DC fast charging, adding up to 100 km of range in just 5 minutes. The performance-oriented dual-motor setup delivers supercar acceleration (0-100 km/h in 3.3s for RS models) with precise torque vectoring. Sustainable materials feature prominently, including vegan leather options and recycled interior components. Advanced thermal management maintains optimal battery temperature in extreme conditions (-28°C to +50°C). The low 0.24 drag coefficient combines with active aerodynamics (including deployable rear spoiler) for efficiency without compromising the dramatic coupe styling. The interior blends cutting-edge technology (virtual cockpit plus, head-up display) with traditional Audi craftsmanship in a driver-focused cockpit."
