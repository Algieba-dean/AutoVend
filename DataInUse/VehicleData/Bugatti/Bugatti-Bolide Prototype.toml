key_details_comments = "The Bugatti Bolide Prototype represents the pinnacle of track-focused hypercar engineering, combining Bugatti's legendary 8.0L quad-turbo W16 engine with an ultra-lightweight (1,240 kg) carbon fiber monocoque chassis. With 1,825 PS (1,800 hp) on 110 octane race fuel and producing a staggering 2,500 kg of downforce at 320 km/h, its performance eclipses even modern Formula 1 cars - achieving 0-500 km/h in just 20.16 seconds. The Bolide features motorsport-derived technologies including pushrod suspension with inboard dampers, magnesium wheels with center-lock hubs, and an advanced aerodynamic package with active elements. Despite its extreme performance, it maintains Bugatti's signature craftsmanship with hand-finished details and bespoke components, making it one of the most exclusive track cars ever created with only 40 units planned for production at approximately $4.8 million USD each."
