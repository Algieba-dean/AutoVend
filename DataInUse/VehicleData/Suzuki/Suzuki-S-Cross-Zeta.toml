[KeyDetails]
key_details = "The Suzuki S-Cross Zeta combines a 1.4L turbocharged mild-hybrid engine with optional ALLGRIP 4WD. Key features include L2 ADAS, 430L boot space, and 180mm ground clearance. Priced competitively against rivals like the Toyota Corolla Cross."
key_details_comments = "The Suzuki S-Cross Zeta is a compelling compact SUV offering a balanced package of efficiency and capability. Its 1.4L Boosterjet mild-hybrid powertrain delivers 129hp combined output while maintaining reasonable fuel economy (6.3L/100km WLTP). The optional ALLGRIP 4WD system enhances all-weather confidence, though ground clearance (180mm) limits serious off-roading. With 430L of cargo space (expandable to 1,200L) and standard L2 ADAS features like adaptive cruise and lane centering, it competes well against segment rivals like the Toyota Corolla Cross. The 48V hybrid system provides torque fill (235N·m from 2,000rpm) but doesn't enable EV-only driving. Priced between $22,000-$28,000 USD, it offers strong value with Suzuki's reliability reputation."
