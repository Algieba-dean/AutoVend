key_details="The Urus Performante features a 4.0L twin-turbo V8 producing 657 hp, carbon fiber components reducing weight by 47 kg, improved aerodynamics with 38% more downforce, and a specially tuned suspension for sharper handling. It's the most powerful and dynamic version of Lamborghini's SUV."
key_details_comments = "The Urus Performante represents the pinnacle of Lamborghini's SUV engineering, featuring a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 657 hp (666 PS) and 850 Nm of torque. Significant weight reduction (47 kg/104 lbs) comes from extensive carbon fiber usage in components like the hood, rear spoiler, and bumper. Aerodynamic improvements generate 38% more downforce than the standard Urus, while the specially tuned suspension (with 20% stiffer springs and 15% stiffer anti-roll bars) enhances handling dynamics. The Performante variant also features unique 22-inch or optional 23-inch wheels with Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R tires, a rear-wheel steering system, and an upgraded exhaust for a more aggressive sound profile. This model sits 20mm lower than the standard Urus and offers three drive modes (Strada, Sport, Corsa) plus an optional off-road mode."
