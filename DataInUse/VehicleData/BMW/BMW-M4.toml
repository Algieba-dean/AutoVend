key_details="The BMW M4 combines a 3.0L twin-turbo S58 engine (up to 543hp) with rear-wheel drive dynamics, carbon fiber roof, and track-focused technologies like 10-stage traction control. Optional M xDrive all-wheel drive (Competition models) and available 6-speed manual transmission (base model only) make it uniquely configurable among performance coupes."
key_details_comments = "The BMW M4 represents the pinnacle of BMW's performance coupe lineup, featuring a hand-built 3.0L S58 twin-turbo inline-6 engine producing up to 543hp in CS specification. Key performance features include: a carbon fiber reinforced plastic roof (saving 6kg while lowering center of gravity), electronically controlled M Differential Lock, and available M xDrive all-wheel drive system (Competition models only) with 2WD mode for drift capability. The chassis incorporates aluminum-intensive suspension components with adaptive damping, while interior highlights include M-specific displays, available carbon fiber bucket seats, and track-focused telemetry systems. Unique among competitors, the base model offers an optional 6-speed manual transmission - a rarity in today's high-performance segment. The M4's combination of German engineering precision and track-ready technologies makes it a benchmark in the $60-100k sports coupe category."
