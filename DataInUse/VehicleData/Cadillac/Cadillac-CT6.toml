Built on a lightweight Omega platform with 64% aluminum content, it featured industry-first Super Cruise hands-free driving (operational on 200,000+ miles of mapped highways). The range-topping 4.2L Blackwing V8 was hand-assembled in Bowling Green, Kentucky, delivering 550hp through a 10-speed automatic. Unique offerings included a 34-speaker AKG Studio Reference audio system, patented Plasma Transferred Wire Arc coating for exhaust components, and optional Night Vision with pedestrian/animal detection. The CT6 also pioneered rear-wheel steering (3.5° adjustment) for improved maneuverability despite its 5.2m length. Discontinued in 2020 due to GM's sedan phase-out, it remains notable for its Magnetic Ride Control 4.0 suspension and semi-autonomous parking capabilities."
