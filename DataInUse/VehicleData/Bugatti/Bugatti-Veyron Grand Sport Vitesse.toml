key_details="The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse is the fastest production convertible in the world, holding the record at 408.84 km/h (254.04 mph). It features a quad-turbocharged 8.0-liter W16 engine producing 1,200 PS, with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and permanent all-wheel drive. The Vitesse version adds more power and aerodynamic enhancements over the standard Grand Sport. Only 92 examples were produced, making it extremely exclusive. The car uses a complex roof system with both removable panels and a folding soft top."
key_details_comments = "The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse represents the pinnacle of automotive engineering, holding the Guinness World Record as the fastest production convertible ever made. Its quad-turbocharged 8.0-liter W16 engine delivers an astonishing 1,200 PS (1,184 hp) and 1,500 N·m (1,106 lb-ft) of torque, channeled through a sophisticated seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and permanent all-wheel drive system. The Vitesse variant builds upon the standard Grand Sport with enhanced aerodynamics, increased power output, and chassis reinforcements. Production was strictly limited to just 92 units worldwide, ensuring exclusivity. The convertible system features both removable polycarbonate roof panels and a folding soft top, allowing multiple open-air configurations. With a 0-100 km/h time of 2.6 seconds and a top speed of 410 km/h (electronically limited), it redefined performance benchmarks for open-top vehicles. The car's development reportedly cost Volkswagen Group over $1.6 billion, with each unit requiring approximately 300 hours of hand assembly at Bugatti's Molsheim atelier."
