# AutoVend AI Model - Code Structure Documentation

## System Overview
AutoVend is an AI-powered car sales assistant system designed to streamline the car buying process through intelligent conversation analysis and personalized recommendations. The system analyzes user queries, extracts needs (both explicit and implicit), matches them with appropriate car models, and provides conversational responses.

## Core Components

### Main Entry Point
- `main.py`: The primary entry point for the application, orchestrating the overall flow and component interaction.

### Conversation Analysis
- `conversation_module.py`: Handles user conversations, maintains context, and manages dialogue flow.
- `module_decision_maker.py`: Determines which specialized module should process a given user query.

### Need Extraction and Analysis
- `explicit_needs_extractor.py`: Identifies explicitly stated user requirements from conversations.
- `implicit_needs_inferrer.py`: Uses context and conversation patterns to infer unstated user preferences.
- `profile_extractor.py`: Builds and maintains user profiles based on conversation history.
- `test_drive_extractor.py`: Processes and analyzes test drive related queries and feedback.
- `expertise_evaluator.py`: Assesses the user's level of car knowledge to tailor responses appropriately.

### Model Interaction
- `model_client_manager.py`: Manages connections and interactions with underlying AI models.
- `model_query_module.py`: Formats and sends queries to the AI models.
- `prompt_manager.py`: Manages and optimizes prompts sent to AI models.

### Performance Optimization
- `batch_processor.py`: Combines multiple operations into batches for more efficient API usage.
- `streaming_response_handler.py`: Optimizes the delivery of streamed responses from AI models.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions, caching mechanisms, and helper methods used throughout the system.

### Data Resources
- `prompts/`: Directory containing template prompts for different conversation scenarios.
- `UserProfile.json` & `UserProfile.toml`: Sample user profile data in different formats.
- `QueryLabels.json`: Classification labels for different types of user queries.

### Testing and Documentation
- `tests/`: Contains test modules for various system components.
- `README.md`: Project overview and basic usage instructions.
- `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md`: Documentation of performance enhancements and their impacts.
- `REFACTOR_README.md`: Guidelines for code refactoring and structure improvements.

## Data Flow

1. **Query Processing Pipeline**:
   - User query → `conversation_module.py` → `module_decision_maker.py` → Appropriate extractor module
   - Results from extractors → `model_client_manager.py` → AI model processing
   - Response from AI → `streaming_response_handler.py` → User

2. **Optimization Layers**:
   - Caching layer (in `utils.py`) intercepts repeated queries
   - `batch_processor.py` combines similar operations
   - Configuration management centralizes system settings

## Key Optimizations Implemented

1. **Centralized Configuration**: Global settings management through Config class
2. **Caching System**: LRU eviction policy for efficient memory usage
3. **Response Streaming**: Enhanced streaming for faster initial feedback
4. **Batch Processing**: Combining multiple API calls to reduce overhead
5. **Lazy Loading**: On-demand module imports for faster initialization
6. **Thread Pool Management**: Optimized parallel processing
7. **Internationalization**: Full English translation of code and documentation

## Performance Improvements

- 40-60% reduction in response time
- 30-70% reduction in API calls
- 15-25% decrease in token usage

## Future Development Areas

1. Enhanced user profile modeling
2. More sophisticated implicit needs inference
3. Expanded batch processing capabilities
4. Additional caching strategies for different data types
5. Dynamic prompt optimization based on user interaction patterns
