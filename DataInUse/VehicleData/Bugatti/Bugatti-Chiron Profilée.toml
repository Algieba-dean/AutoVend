key_details_comments = "The Bugatti Chiron Profilée is an ultra-exclusive, limited-production hypercar with only 40 units ever made. It represents a refined version of the Chiron, featuring a unique aerodynamic body with a longer tail section for improved high-speed stability. At its heart lies an 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W16 engine producing 1,500 horsepower and 1,600 N·m of torque, making it one of the most powerful production cars ever built. The interior showcases Bugatti's legendary craftsmanship with hand-stitched leather, aluminum accents, and customizable options. Despite its extreme performance focus (0-100 km/h in 2.3 seconds, top speed of 380 km/h), it includes modern driver assistance systems like adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist. The Profilée bridges the gap between the standard Chiron and track-focused Chiron Pur Sport, offering both extreme performance and daily drivability for the select few who can afford its approximately $5.4 million USD price tag."
