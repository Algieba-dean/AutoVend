key_details = "The Cadillac SRX (2010-2016) was a mid-size luxury SUV featuring a 3.0L or 3.6L V6, FWD/AWD options, and Cadillac's CUE infotainment. Notable for its Art & Science design, it competed with European rivals but emphasized comfort over sportiness. Discontinued and replaced by the XT5 in 2017."
key_details_comments = "The 2010-2016 Cadillac SRX was a pivotal model in Cadillac's SUV lineup, bridging traditional luxury with modern crossover utility. Its 3.6L V6 produced 308 hp (Premium trim) and featured advanced tech like Magnetic Ride Control and the controversial but innovative Cadillac User Experience (CUE) touch interface. The SRX earned IIHS Top Safety Pick status and was built on GM's Theta Premium platform shared with the Saab 9-4X. Notably, it offered one of the segment's largest standard fuel tanks (79L) for extended range, though its angular design resulted in a relatively poor 0.35 drag coefficient. Production occurred in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, with over 250,000 units sold during its lifespan before being replaced by the more modern XT5."
