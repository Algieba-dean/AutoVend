key_details_comments = "The Porsche 911 GT3 represents the pinnacle of Porsche's naturally aspirated sports car engineering, featuring a motorsport-derived 4.0L flat-six engine that revs to 9,000 rpm. Its track-focused design includes a lightweight body (1,435 kg), rear-axle steering (optional), and race-bred suspension for exceptional handling. The aerodynamic package generates 385 lbs of downforce at 124 mph via its large rear wing. Available with either a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission (with automatic rev-matching) or a 6-speed manual for purists, the GT3 bridges the gap between road and race cars while maintaining Porsche's legendary daily usability. The interior features Alcantara and carbon fiber trim, with optional full bucket seats and a Clubsport package including a roll cage. This model serves as the most driver-focused variant in the 911 lineup before the more extreme GT3 RS."
