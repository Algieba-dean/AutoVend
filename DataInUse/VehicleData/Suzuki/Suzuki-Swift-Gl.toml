key_details_comments = "The Suzuki Swift-GL is a budget-friendly subcompact hatchback designed for urban mobility, featuring a lightweight construction (860kg) for improved fuel efficiency. Its 1.2L K12M Dualjet engine delivers 83hp, paired with either a 5-speed manual or optional 4-speed automatic transmission. The car offers basic safety features including dual airbags, ABS with EBD, and ISOFIX anchors, while maintaining a sporty aesthetic with projector headlamps and 15-inch alloy wheels on higher trims. The compact dimensions (3,840mm length) make it exceptionally maneuverable in city traffic, though rear passenger space is limited. Fuel efficiency is a strong point at 4.9L/100km combined, with a 37L fuel tank providing 350-400km range. The torsion beam rear suspension prioritizes cost-effectiveness over ride comfort, making it best suited for short to medium commutes rather than long-distance touring."
