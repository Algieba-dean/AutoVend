key_details_comments = "The Cadillac ELR (2014-2016) was a groundbreaking luxury plug-in hybrid coupe that combined GM's Voltec powertrain technology with Cadillac's premium craftsmanship. Based on the Chevrolet Volt's architecture but significantly upgraded, it featured a 1.4L range-extender gasoline engine supporting a 16.5kWh lithium-ion battery (10.5kWh usable) and a 154kW electric motor. The ELR stood out with its dramatic Art & Science design language, featuring angular lines, LED lighting signatures, and a sleek fastback profile. The interior showcased hand-stitched leather, real wood accents, and cutting-edge technology like the Cadillac User Experience (CUE) infotainment system. With 37 miles (60km) of pure electric range and 340 miles (547km) total range, it offered both eco-friendly commuting and long-distance capability. The ELR's advanced features included Magnetic Ride Control suspension, regenerative braking, and available driver assistance systems. Limited production (under 3,000 units total) and its unique positioning as a luxury electrified coupe make it a rare collector's item today, representing Cadillac's early foray into premium electrified vehicles."
