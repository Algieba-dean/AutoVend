The lineup offers two distinct performance levels: the standard V-Series with a 3.0L twin-turbo V6 producing 360hp, and the ultra-high-performance Blackwing variant featuring a hand-built 6.2L supercharged V8 delivering 668hp. Key technological highlights include the latest Magnetic Ride Control 4.0 suspension system for adaptive damping, massive Brembo brakes with 6-piston front calipers, and an available 10-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. The interior combines luxury and technology with semi-aniline leather seats, real carbon fiber trim, a 12-inch digital instrument cluster, and a 10-inch touchscreen with Cadillac's latest infotainment system. Unique to the segment is the available Super Cruise system, offering hands-free driving capability on over 200,000 miles of compatible highways in North America. The Blackwing models feature additional performance enhancements like a limited-slip differential, performance traction management, and available carbon ceramic brakes, making them legitimate competitors to European sports sedans from BMW M and Mercedes-AMG."
