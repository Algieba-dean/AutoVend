Built on Mazda's proven Skyactiv platform but with reinforced underbody protection, it offers 210mm of ground clearance while maintaining the brand's signature driving dynamics. Unique features include Mazda's first panoramic moonroof, specially developed Polymetal Gray and Zircon Sand Metallic exterior colors, and an interior designed with outdoor enthusiasts in mind (including available water-resistant seat materials). The CX-50 is manufactured in Mazda's new Alabama plant (joint venture with Toyota) specifically for North American markets, featuring standard i-Activ AWD with off-road traction modes. It bridges the gap between Mazda's premium aspirations (with available Nappa leather and authentic metal trim) and genuine outdoor capability (roof rails rated for 220 lbs and available tow hitch). The vehicle represents Mazda's interpretation of 'rugged luxury,' combining precise on-road handling with light off-road competence through specially tuned suspension and Mazda's predictive AWD system."
