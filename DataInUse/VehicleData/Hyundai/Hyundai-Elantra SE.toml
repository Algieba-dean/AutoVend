[KeyDetails]
key_details = "The 2024 Hyundai Elantra SE offers a balance of value and features with its 2.0L engine delivering 147 hp, achieving 33 mpg combined.

key_details_comments = "The 2024 Hyundai Elantra SE represents an excellent value proposition in the compact sedan segment, offering a compelling combination of features, efficiency, and affordability. Its 2.0L MPI 4-cylinder engine delivers 147 horsepower while achieving an EPA-estimated 33 mpg combined, making it both capable and fuel-efficient for daily commuting. The inclusion of Hyundai's SmartSense safety suite as standard equipment (including Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist and Lane Keeping Assist) provides important active safety technologies typically found in more expensive vehicles. With a starting MSRP of $21,245 USD, it undercuts many competitors while offering comparable or better standard features. The Elantra SE particularly shines as an urban commuter with its compact dimensions (184.1 inches long) and tight turning radius, yet remains comfortable enough for highway trips. While it lacks some premium amenities of higher trims, it maintains Hyundai's strong warranty coverage (5-year/60,000-mile basic, 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain) that adds significant long-term value. The SE trim competes directly with base models like the Toyota Corolla LE and Honda Civic LX, often offering more standard technology and safety features at a similar price point."
