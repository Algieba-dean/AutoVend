[KeyDetails]
# key_details, a value to introduce more KeyDetails for current car model
key_details="The Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray is the first electrified Corvette, combining a 6.2L V8 with an electric motor for 655 hp total output. It features all-wheel drive, a 0-60 mph time of 2.5 seconds, and maintains the Corvette's signature performance while adding hybrid efficiency. Key innovations include torque vectoring, regenerative braking, and a unique 'Stealth Mode' for electric-only driving at low speeds."
key_details_comments = "The Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray marks a historic milestone as the first electrified Corvette, blending a 6.2L LT2 V8 engine with a 160kW electric motor for a combined 655 hp and 785 N·m of torque. This hybrid sports car introduces all-wheel drive to the Corvette lineup through an innovative eAWD system with electric front drive and mechanical rear drive. Performance highlights include a blistering 0-60 mph (0-97 km/h) time of 2.5 seconds and a top speed of 194 mph (312 km/h). The E-Ray features advanced technologies like regenerative braking, torque vectoring, and Magnetic Ride Control 4.0 suspension. Unique to this model is 'Stealth Mode' enabling near-silent electric-only operation at low speeds (up to 45 mph/72 km/h). Despite its hybrid nature, it maintains the Corvette's sports car essence with a mid-engine layout, 50:50 weight distribution, and track-capable handling. The 1.9kWh battery provides hybrid assist rather than full EV capability, focusing on performance enhancement rather than pure electric range. Practical touches include 357L of cargo space (split between front and rear compartments) and modern amenities like the Chevrolet Infotainment 3 system with voice control and OTA updates."
