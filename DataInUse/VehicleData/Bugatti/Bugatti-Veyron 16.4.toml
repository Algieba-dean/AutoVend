[KeyDetails]
# key_details, a value to introduce more KeyDetails for current car model
key_details = "The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 redefined hypercar performance with its quad-turbo W16 engine, all-wheel drive system, and unprecedented top speed. It was the first production car to exceed 400 km/h (250 mph) and required extensive engineering to manage aerodynamics, tire technology, and cooling at these extreme speeds. The Veyron's development reportedly cost Volkswagen over $1.6 billion, with each car sold at a significant loss despite its multi-million dollar price tag."
key_details_comments = "The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 was a groundbreaking hypercar that pushed automotive engineering boundaries with its quad-turbo W16 engine producing up to 1,200hp in Super Sport trim. It featured advanced aerodynamics with an active rear wing, specially developed Michelin tires rated for 400+ km/h, and a sophisticated all-wheel drive system. The car's development famously required solving unprecedented challenges in cooling (with 10 radiators), braking (carbon-ceramic brakes), and structural integrity at extreme speeds. Each Veyron took approximately 300 hours to assemble by hand at Bugatti's Molsheim factory."
