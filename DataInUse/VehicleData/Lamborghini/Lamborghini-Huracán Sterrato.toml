key_details="The Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato is a radical off-road version of the Huracán supercar, featuring raised suspension, all-terrain tires, and reinforced body cladding. It retains the 5.2L V10 engine producing 610hp but adds unique rally-inspired capabilities while maintaining Lamborghini's signature performance."
key_details_comments = "The Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato represents a bold departure from traditional supercars, blending high-performance with off-road capability. It features a 1.7-inch raised suspension, specially developed Bridgestone Dueler AT002 all-terrain tires, and reinforced underbody protection. The 5.2L naturally aspirated V10 produces 610hp and 560Nm, paired with an all-wheel-drive system adapted for loose surfaces. Unique design elements include flared wheel arches, roof-mounted air intake, and LED light bar. While maintaining 0-100km/h in 3.4 seconds, it offers new driving modes (Rally and Strada) specifically tuned for off-pavement driving. This model combines Lamborghini's supercar DNA with rally-inspired versatility, creating a new segment of high-performance off-road vehicles."
